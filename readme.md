PROJECT 1

Utilize an API to open up a stock quote and pull certain information such as:
    1) Price
    2) average trading volume
    3) mkt cap
    4) shares outstanding
    5) option open interest

Build and implement an algorythm to rate a 'bull vs. bear' outcome/rating. This is used to determine which GIF/Pic is displayed using and If/Else statement. 

The General concept of StonkyBvB.com is that you place an inquary for a stock ticker and receive certain data in a pop-up message, then can ask if StonkyBvB is Bullish or Bearish on the particular ticker.
