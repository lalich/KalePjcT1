# PROJECT 1 - StonkyBvB

Utilize an API to open up a stock quote and pull certain information such as:
1. Price
2. Average Trading Volume(10D)
3. Market Capitalization
4. Shares Outstanding
5. Option Open Interest

Build and implement an algorythm to rate a 'bull vs. bear' outcome/rating. This is used to determine which GIF/Pic is displayed using and If/Else statement. 

The General concept of StonkyBvB.com is that you place an inquary for a stock ticker and receive certain data in a results message. The user then has the option to ask the StonkyBvB Magic-8-Ball wheather to be Bullish or Bearish on the Stonk.
